b)
Write "The average is"
Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
Write avg

c)
If(n1<n2)
Set max to n2
Else
 Set max to n1
If(n3>max)
Set max to n3
If (n4>max)
Set max to n4
If (n5>max)
Set max to n5
Write "The max is"
Write max

If (n1>n2)
Set min to n2
Else Set min to n1
If (n3<min)
Set min to n3
If (n4<min)
Set min to n4
If(n5<min)
Set min to n5
Write "The min is"
Write Min

d)
Write"The Result from step b is 5 and the result from Step c is 1 is the Minimum and maximum is 5"
